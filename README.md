#  Billboard Hot 100 Year End Charts Analysis (2020-2024)
## Background
The *Billboard* Hot 100 Year End Chart is an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout the year in the Unitied States published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan. Each week information about a single's physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming is collected and used to determined its ranking on the weekly chart. At the end of each year, a list is published based on that year's best performing songs.
## Project Goals
When creating the project, I had the following goals in mind that I wanted to achive:
* Gather interesting/insightful information about the different songs and artists appearing on each year's chart. (i.e., Which artists appear the most?)
* Find trends within certain categories or throughout the years.
* Combine the two above to determine the characteristics that a song may need to have in order to rank well on the year end chart. <br>

With these findings, not only artists, but also record labels and others in the music industry, can use the the information to increases their chances
of having having a hit single or sign the next big artist all from analyzing the most sucessful songs of the past few years.
